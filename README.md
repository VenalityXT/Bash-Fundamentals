# Bash Scripting Foundations

This repository exists as a fast, practical reference for writing clean, modern **Bash**, especially for automation, SOC tooling, and daily scripting tasks.  
If you're like me and want **shortcuts, cleaner patterns, and “better ways”** to write scripts from day one, this is for you.

Think of this as a cheat sheet for writing smarter, more expressive Bash.

### “We start with humble beginnings…”

```bash
echo "Hello, world."
# Basic echo — works, but doesn't scale when you need variables or formatting.
```

Now, the improved versions:

```bash
name="Michael"

echo "Hello, $name"       
# Basic variable interpolation

printf "Hello, %s\n" "$name"
# More control, formatting, no unintended spaces

echo "Hello, ${name}"
# Braces prevent edge-case parsing issues
```

---

# Variables

```bash
x=5
y=10
z=15
# Variables are untyped strings unless used numerically.
```

**Multiple assignment (clean grouping pattern)**  
Bash doesn’t support tuple unpacking, but grouping improves readability:

```bash
a=5; b=10; c=15
```

**Command substitution**

```bash
now=$(date)
# $( ) is preferred over backticks.
```

**Arithmetic context**

```bash
total=$((x + y + z))
```

---

# Arrays

```bash
servers=("splunk" "pfsense" "core-switch")
# Ordered, zero-indexed list.
```

**Append items**

```bash
servers+=("kali")
```

**Array slicing**

```bash
subset=("${servers[@]:1:2}")
# Start at index 1, take 2 items.
```

**Iterate through arrays**

```bash
for srv in "${servers[@]}"; do
    echo "$srv"
done
```

---

# Associative Arrays

```bash
declare -A user=(
    ["username"]="michael"
    ["role"]="analyst"
)
# Key-value pairs, similar to Python dictionaries.
```

**Add/modify keys**

```bash
user["privileges"]="read,write"
```

**Iterate keys & values**

```bash
for key in "${!user[@]}"; do
    echo "$key = ${user[$key]}"
done
```

---

# If / Else

```bash
if [[ $x -gt 5 ]]; then
    echo "Big number"
else
    echo "Small number"
fi
```

**One-line conditional**

```bash
[[ $x -gt 5 ]] && echo "Big" || echo "Small"
```

**Check if array has elements**

```bash
if [[ ${#servers[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "Servers exist"
fi
```

---

# Loops

```bash
for srv in "${servers[@]}"; do
    echo "$srv"
done
```

**Indexed loop**

```bash
for i in "${!servers[@]}"; do
    echo "$i: ${servers[$i]}"
done
```

**Parallel iteration (manual zip pattern)**

```bash
ports=(514 443 8000)

for i in "${!servers[@]}"; do
    echo "${servers[$i]} on port ${ports[$i]}"
done
```

**Filtering**

```bash
for srv in "${servers[@]}"; do
    [[ $srv == *"splunk"* ]] && echo "Critical: $srv"
done
```

---

# Functions

```bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1"
}
```

**Default parameter**

```bash
greet() {
    local name="${1:-stranger}"
    echo "Hello, $name"
}
```

**Variadic positional arguments**

```bash
audit() {
    for host in "$@"; do
        echo "Auditing $host"
    done
}
```

**Returning values**  
Bash cannot “return a string.” You echo it and capture it.

```bash
result=$(greet "Michael")
```

---

# Error Handling

**Basic try/catch pattern using exit codes**

```bash
if ! cp missing.txt /tmp/output; then
    echo "Copy failed."
fi
```

**Exit immediately on errors (strict mode)**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# e = exit on error
# u = error on undefined variables
# o pipefail = catch failures inside pipelines
```

---

# File I/O

**Write to a file**

```bash
echo "Document everything." > notes.txt
```

**Append**

```bash
echo "Another line" >> notes.txt
```

**Read file line-by-line**

```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "$line"
done < notes.txt
```

---

# Environment & Execution

**Make script executable**

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

**Run script**

```bash
./script.sh
```

**Check environment variables**

```bash
echo "$PATH"
```

---

# Useful Built-ins

```bash
printf "%s\n" "Clean printing"
basename /path/to/file.txt
dirname /path/to/file.txt
cut -d':' -f1 /etc/passwd
grep "failed" auth.log
awk '{print $1, $NF}' file
```

These form the backbone of real Bash automation.

# Sample Script (Challenge)

Before running it, see if you can figure out:  
1. What it prints  
2. What file it creates  
3. Where the error occurs  
4. What ends up in the log  

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

servers=("splunk" "pfsense" "kali")

declare -A config=(
    ["mode"]="secure"
    ["retries"]="3"
    ["timeout"]="10"
)

audit() {
    local i=1
    for host in "$@"; do
        echo "$i. Auditing $host..."
        ((i++))
    done
    echo "Finished auditing $# host(s)."
}

generate_report() {
    local ts
    ts=$(date -Iseconds)
    echo "$ts REPORT action=$1 targets=${servers[*]} config=${config[*]}"
}

risky_operation() {
    return 1   # Always fails, simulating an error
}

main() {
    echo "=== Demo Script Starting ==="

    # List statuses
    for srv in "${servers[@]}"; do
        statuses+=("Pinging $srv...")
    done
    printf "Statuses generated: %s\n" "${statuses[*]}"

    audit "${servers[@]}"

    [[ ${#servers[@]} -gt 0 ]] && echo "Server list is not empty."

    log_path="automation_log.txt"
    generate_report "audit" > "$log_path"
    echo "Report written to: $(realpath "$log_path")"

    if ! risky_operation; then
        echo "Error caught: risky_operation failed"
    fi

    echo "=== Demo Script Complete ==="
}

main "$@"
```

# SOC Automation Example

This example simulates a lightweight SOC automation tool that:

- Reads a log file  
- Detects multiple failed logins from the same IP  
- Flags potential brute force attacks  
- Writes findings to a report  

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

log_file="auth.log"

# Sample logs the script generates
cat > "$log_file" <<EOF
2025-01-01 10:10:01 Failed login from 192.168.1.10
2025-01-01 10:10:02 Failed login from 192.168.1.10
2025-01-01 10:10:05 Failed login from 10.0.0.5
2025-01-01 10:10:07 Failed login from 192.168.1.10
EOF

declare -A failures=()

# Count failed attempts
while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ $line == *"Failed login"* ]]; then
        ip="${line##* }"
        ((failures["$ip"]++))
    fi
done < "$log_file"

# Build alerts
alerts=()
for ip in "${!failures[@]}"; do
    if [[ ${failures[$ip]} -ge 3 ]]; then
        alerts+=("Brute force suspected from $ip (${failures[$ip]} failures)")
    fi
done

report="soc_report.txt"
{
    if ((${#alerts[@]})); then
        printf "%s\n" "${alerts[@]}"
    else
        echo "No threats detected."
    fi
} > "$report"

echo "SOC Report Generated: $(realpath "$report")"
```

### Why this matters  
This tiny example demonstrates concepts used constantly in SOC environments:

- Log parsing  
- Pattern extraction  
- Aggregation  
- Threshold-based alerting  
- Lightweight automation  

It mirrors everything you learned above — showing how foundational Bash skills translate directly into real cybersecurity work.

# Final Thoughts

This guide isn’t meant to teach Bash from scratch.  
It’s meant to make you **dangerous quickly**, giving you the expressive tools used by real engineers and analysts.

Use these patterns as your baseline.  
From here, everything you automate becomes cleaner, faster, and easier to maintain.
